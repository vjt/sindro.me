Hello! I'm Marcello Barnaba, an Italian computer nerd, born on April, 11th
1981, currently located in [Rome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome).

My interests range from Software Development to Computer Networks and Security,
from Maths to Physics and Astronomy, Sociology... more generally, anything
that's Science related. I do not endorse faith-related thinkings, and I'm
hardly capable of remembering something if I haven't fully grasped the inner
workings of a system (of any kind).

I could define myself as a strong follower of the [Hacker
culture](http://catb.org/jargon) and its way of thinking and open-mindness, but
I regret being referred to as a Computer Hacker, because I know that "my wisdom
is limited to an awareness of my own ignorance"
([Socrates'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socrates#Philosophical_beliefs)
principle).

I may be referred to as a Geek or Nerd, and I'm very proud of it :).

I'm a strong advocate of the [Open Source](http://opensource.org/) Movement and
[Culture](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/), I try to spend efforts in Open
Source software whenever possible – check out [my github
account](http://github.com/vjt).

My favorite Programming Language (ATM) is [Ruby](http://ruby-lang.org/), I use
to write software also in C, C++, Perl, PHP and Erlang.

I'm now working for a specialized agency of the United Nations,
[IFAD](http://www.ifad.org/), I travel around for technology/security
conferences and [SCUBA diving](http://www.acquazzurra.it/), taking photos,
writing diaries and enjoying life – that's too short to wonder why :). I also
[tweet](http://twitter.com/vjt) and
[share](https://plus.google.com/107382538213680942210) stuff on the interwebs.

**Have a good time here on [sindro.me](/)!**
