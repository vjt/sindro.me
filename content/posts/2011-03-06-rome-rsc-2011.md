Thanks to [@jodosha](http://twitter.com/jodosha) efforts and praising the
former ~~Javaday~~ event, now renamed into [codemotion](http://codemotion.it/)
that brought in Rome many Ruby developers from Milan, Padua and other parts of
Italy â€“ the first *official* Ruby Social Club in Rome has been a great success.
Of course, *officialty* is measured **only** in the amount of twitter spam
posted about it! :-): earlier RSCs in Rome [go back in time to
2006](http://ruby-it.org/pages/Primo+incontro+del+Ruby+Social+Club+a+Roma)
organized by current [mikamai](http://mikamai.com/) members and more meetups
promoted by [@jeko](http://twitter.com/jeko) [in
2007](https://www.ruby-forum.com/search?query=ruby+social+club+roma).

What matters is that there's a community, there's a passion, and there's love
to share knowledge - no matter who holds the meetings, the important thing is
that they're being held :-).

The event was simple and direct - some beers first, then my keynote on RVM and
Ruby interpreters, then Luca's one announcing his
[minege.ms](http://minege.ms/) project and after **real** social networking
:-). I met [@gravityblast](http://twitter.com/gravityblast) after much time we
didn't meet, knew the [PIP](http://programmersinpadua.it/) group and met
[@svarione](http://twitter.com/svarione),
[@punkmanit](http://twitter.com/punkmanit),
[@leonardoperna](http://twitter.com/leonardoperna),
[@riggasconi](http://twitter.com/riggasconi),
[@ogeidix](http://twitter.com/ogeidix) and other smart people. Moreover, we
spent quite some nice time together, making up a really lousy and funny
week-end.  Of course, huge kudos to [@nhaima](http://twitter.com/nhaima)'s car
\- that tirelessly carried us around Rome for two days :-)

Now, looking forward to the next meetup, **thanks** everyone who participed,
who offered me beers and, last but not least, thanks to
[@etapeta](http://twitter.com/etapeta) for bringing me in time at the meeting -
you're the real hero :-).
