```ruby
22:33:24 vjt@voyager:~$ irb19 -f
irb(main):001:0> Symbol.all_symbols.grep /^the/
=> [:the_answer_to_life_the_universe_and_everything]
```

unluckily, the answer isnâ€™t 42:

```ruby
irb(main):002:0> _.first.object_id
=> 5048
```

:\

Thanks for this strange finding, [nextie](https://deref.blogspot.com)! :D
