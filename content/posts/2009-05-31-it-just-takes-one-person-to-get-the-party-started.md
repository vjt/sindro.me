- The **sad** conclusion: "humans are such herd animals"

- The **good** conclusion: "virality has always existed, it's not an invention
of Web2.0. Social networking is just a powerful tool for everyone that wants to
change the world"

- The **mean** conclusion: "how much does it take to get people from their
computers to the real world after a virtual 'heads up' by some 'dancing man'?"

- More conclusions: read the comments on this video [on
