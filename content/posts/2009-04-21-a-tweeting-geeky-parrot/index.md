I'm searching for a new pet. [We](https://nhaima.org/) already have two
[lovely cats](http://www.vimeo.com/3562500), but after feeling how alive a
house can be with many pets (after a beautiful night @ [il
quadrato](http://www.2spaghi.it/ristoranti/lazio/lt/latina/il-quadrato/)
mansion), I'm thinking about having another one to grow and love.

But, what kind of geek am I, if I don't add a nerdy bit to it? So, after the
[brain twitter interface](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=205dHV55XWQ) about
which we [talked about so
much](http://blog.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/04/braintweet.html) [in the last
days](http://search.twitter.com/search?max_id=1578807214&page=1&q=brain+twitter+interface),
this evening a quite random funny thought has stumbled into my mind: what about
getting a [grey parrot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Grey_Parrot), grow
it, learn it to talk, and letting him .. well, **tweet** his words using a
speech recognition system put right aside its bar and linked to a twitter
account? How weird would that be?! :D

Thinking deeply, the weirdest thing is that in 2009, a tweeting parrot makes me
think about a "parrot with access to twitter" .. and not a bird emitting its
natural verse. Am I overloaded by this social media thingie? Should I take some
vacation?

I guess. But not right now. The first [Italian Facebook Developer
Garage](http://fb.mikamai.com/) is right two days away.. :)
