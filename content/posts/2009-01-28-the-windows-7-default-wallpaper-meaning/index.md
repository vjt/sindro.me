When you install the [developer beta of Windows
7](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/beta-download.aspx), after the
usual 3 reboots cycle, you are greeted with the following image:

It is the [Siamese fighting fish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betta_fish), a
beautiful tropical fish, but with an interesting characteristic: it is
extremely aggressive. It is popular belief that two males fight themselves even
in the wild, but that's not quite true. This belief descends from the behaviour
of the fish into an aquarium, where *the victor continuously attacking the
loser, eventually causing the loser's death*.

Now, think about the software ecosystem as an aquarium. And think about
Microsoft into this aquarium. The latest release of Microsoft OS has an
aggressive fish as its default skin, and it is alone in this aquarium. And
there's no place for anyone else: they'll fight whoever adversary, even if it's
from the same species.

What's uncertain is .. they'll succeed, or not? :). We'll see!
